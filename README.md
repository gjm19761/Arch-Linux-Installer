Arch Linux Install Script for a customized Arch Linux system.

Our script is used after booting from the latest original Arch Linux installation media.

It contains the same commands that you would type and execute one by one interactively to complete the installation. This automation makes the installation easy and fast, as fast as your internet connection allows.


Boot. Get. Configure. Install. Enjoy.

**Warning! This script can delete all partitions of the persistent storage. It is recommended to test it first in a virtual machine like <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>.**

Currently these scripts are for me, but maybe they are useful for you too.

Follow the [Arch Way](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_Linux) of doing things and learn what this script does. This will allow you to know what is happening.

Please, don't ask for support for this script in Arch Linux forums, first read the [Arch Linux wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org), the [Installation Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) and the [General Recommendations](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/General_recommendations), later compare those commands with the commands of this script.
